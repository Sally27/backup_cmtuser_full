'''
Module for producing overlap tables of lines.

WARNING : The DaVinci version must coincide with the one used for
          the stripping production in the file, as retrocompatibility
          is not guaranteed in all cases.
          
After the environment is set run with:

python WGs_lines_overlap.py -wg <WGs> -min_overlap <threshold> -input_file <file>

   <WGs> can be any single WG or combination of WGs, separated by spaces
   it also admits ALL as a WG (gets all the WGs)

   <threshold> determines the minimum overlap percentage between two different
   lines for them to be printed in the tables

   <file> is the intersections file, formatted as
      strippingversion.line1.line2 overlap

It will produce two files,
<WG>_Stripping_Lines_overlaps_min_<threshold>_percent.log
   A TWiki formatted table of the overlaps
<WG>_Stripping_Lines_overlaps_min_<threshold>_percent.pdf
   A 2D histogram of the overlaps
